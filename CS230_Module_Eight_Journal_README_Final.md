# CS 230 Module Eight Journal Reflection

## Project Summary
The client for this project was **The Gaming Room**, which requested a scalable, web-based version of their Android game **Draw It or Lose It**. The project involved designing a distributed game application supporting multiple teams and players, ensuring unique names across entities, and maintaining a single active game instance in memory. The application needed to be highly scalable, web-compatible, and ready for future platform expansion (iOS, Windows, Linux, macOS).

## Strengths in Documentation
One of my strengths in developing this documentation was providing a **structured, forward-thinking architecture** that emphasized scalability, security, and performance. I clearly integrated object-oriented principles like the Singleton and Iterator patterns, which aligned technical requirements with real-world constraints.

## Helpful Parts of the Design Process
Working through a complete software design document before coding helped me **anticipate potential scalability, memory, and security challenges** early on. It created a blueprint that made the future development phase more strategic, reducing the risk of architectural rewrites later.

## Revisions I Would Make
If I could revise any part, I would add **more detailed real-time performance benchmarks** and **visual system diagrams** to make the documentation even clearer for new developers. Future versions would benefit from high-level sequence diagrams and memory profiling mockups.

## User Needs and Implementation
I interpreted the userâ€™s needs by focusing on **cross-platform access, real-time responsiveness, security, and simplicity**. Meeting the end-user and business requirements was critical to ensure a satisfying, fluid gaming experience and smooth administrative control.

## Approach to Software Design
My approach combined **object-oriented design, modularity, and cloud-scalable principles**. In the future, I would continue using strategies like microservices, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and leveraging open-source cloud-native architectures to ensure cost-effective scalability and resilience.
